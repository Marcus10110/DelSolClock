This is a general software architecture question: Why does the IDelSolDevice interface exist? What value does it have, when compared to just having the concrete implementation?
Same goes for other interfaces.

BleConnectionManager ergonomics: it seems like this searches for potential devices and connects to the first one. I would like to break this up a bit - instead, for discovery: if we're not already connected to a device, then I'd like the UI to show if there is a matching device in range or not. If there is, the UI should allow the user to click a button to pair it. The pairing operation might still fail, but this way the user knows what to expect before they try pairing. When we don't have a device connected, it would be nice to either auto-refresh this or allow the user to refresh manually. Perhaps we only need to support manual refresh at this level, and a higher level could use a timer to refresh periodically?

If a already paired device was disconnected, and then appears again, will the phone/PC automatically reconnect to it? If so, do we need the ConnectToKnownDeviceAsync function? If not, then like above, if the app is not connected, and a known device is in range, it would be nice to show that before the user initiates a connection.

For StartStatusNotificationsAsync and StopStatusNotificationsAsync, do these need to be explicit methods, or could we just always subscribe when we create the service, and unsubscribe when the service is disposed?

I am not familiar with .NET maui development. Could you explain the purpose of registering these managers with the MauiApp builder?

My current application does not call builder.Services.AddTransient either. what does this do?
